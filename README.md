# Year 3 Bachelor Projects

Welcome to my repository of projects from the third year (L3) of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Paris Cit√© University. This repository is organized into several subdirectories, each representing a different project or category of projects.

## About

This repository contains a collection of projects that I have worked on during my third year of studies. The projects cover a range of topics and technologies in the field of computer science. I will be updating this repository regularly, adding more projects and improving existing ones.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Algorithmics Projects**: Contains projects related to algorithms and data structures.
- **Image Processing Projects**: Contains projects focused on image processing techniques.
- **Other Categories**: Additional folders for other types of projects or subjects.

Each project subdirectory contains its own README file with detailed information about the project, including setup instructions, usage, and other relevant details.
