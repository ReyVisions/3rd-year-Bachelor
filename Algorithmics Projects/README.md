# Advanced Algorithms in Year 3

Welcome to the repository dedicated to advanced algorithms at the Year 3 level. This repository contains resources, exercises, and projects to deepen your knowledge of algorithms, hash tables, and tree structures.

## Course Descriptions

### Advanced Algorithms

In this course, we explore advanced concepts in algorithms, including:

- **Algorithmic Complexity**: Analysis of algorithms and the study of their time and space complexity. Understanding how to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time and space.

- **Advanced Sorting Algorithms**: Study and implementation of various sorting algorithms such as QuickSort, MergeSort, and HeapSort. Comparison of their performance and use cases.

- **Graphs and Graph Algorithms**:
  - **Graphs**: Data structures composed of vertices and edges, used to model relationships between objects.
  - **Graph Coloring**: Assigning colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Applications in scheduling and resource allocation.
  - **Flows**: Algorithms for calculating maximum flows in networks, used in transportation and circulation problems.
  - **Bipartite Graphs**: Graphs whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no edge connects two vertices of the same set. Applications in matching problems.
  - **Trees**: Hierarchical data structures used to represent data in an organized manner. Study of binary trees, AVL trees, binary search trees, etc.
  - **Poster and Merchant Dilemma**: A classic optimization and decision-making problem in graphs, illustrating trade-offs between different objectives.

- **Graph Traversal**: Depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms, and their applications in pathfinding and connectivity.

- **Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford Algorithms**: Algorithms for finding the shortest paths in weighted graphs, with and without negative weights.

### Hash Tables

Hash tables are a fundamental data structure in computer science. They allow efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. Here are some key points covered:

- **Hash Functions**: Design and analysis of efficient hash functions to uniformly distribute keys.
- **Collision Resolution**: Techniques for resolving collisions such as chaining and open addressing.
- **Practical Applications**: Use of hash tables in real-world applications such as databases and caches.

### Tree Structures

Tree structures are hierarchical data structures used to represent data in an organized manner. We cover:

- **Types of Trees**: Study of binary trees, AVL trees, binary search trees, n-ary trees, etc.
- **Tree Operations**: Insertion, deletion, search, and traversal (depth-first and breadth-first).
- **Applications**: Use of trees in databases, file systems, and compression algorithms.
